The International Darth Vader project was part of a Senior Design capstone project completed at North Carolina State University in December 2016. 

High-level and detailed design documentation can be found in this repo to detail the general and specific concept of the project as it worked in conjunction with the local community in Durham, NC. 

This project was completed as a group of four (4)--each individual responsible for one aspect of the project. 

My responsibility was that of Android mobile application developer, creating a mobile app to communicate with the onboard Raspberry Pi unit that was in the Darth Vader doll itself. 

All code was written in Android Studio and is included in this repo under the folder "International-Darth-Vader-App".
